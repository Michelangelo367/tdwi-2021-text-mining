One Redditor advised it is good to wait and charge when it gets to 20% for data analysis purposes so my range predictions will be more accurate. For an idea of the amount of driving I do. We bought it on 12/19. The drive home after buying was 118 miles. The car currently has 334 miles on it, so I'm averaging about 108 miles a week.</td>\n",

Probably 90% of users in this sub complain about quality and issues they had to fix after delivery, every YouTuber making fun of Tesla because of their panel gaps and fit in general and it takes forever to fix this issues because of even worse customer support. I mean, how hard it is to hire extra people to check fit and finish inside factory before shipping? * It will save tons of money to Tesla compared to after delivery fixes * Less calls to customer support and they might improve support for people with more serious issues * More time for service center and their technicians to fix more serious issues and faster turnaround * Way less bad reviews because of stupid panel gaps. Reason for posting this is that Ford is pushing hard Mach-E to YouTubers for reviews and every Mach-E review I have seen, says that Mach-E is better because of fit and finish, there's literally no other benefit to get Mach-E but when people pay $50k+, this details matter. Even Model Y they provided to MKBHD, had freaking panel gaps. How dumb person in charge for delivering car to MKBHD was to ignore this kind of issues? Am I missing something or why Tesla prefers after delivery fixes over fixing this minor details in factory? Are they willing to spend more in after delivery fixes and risk negative reviews just to increase \"delivery numbers\"? It's really weird move from company that doesn't spend any money in marketing and it sales literally depends on good reviews...

Now I've been looking into numerous things I can do to extend the life of my car without actually replacing it being that it's paid off. First solution would of course be doing the labor intensive valve stem seal job. Which I was quoted from a local indy mechanic $3000. Which is actually a bit more reasonable than getting it done at bmw which would probably charge me $4000-5000 more Next would be getting the crate motor from bmw costing 3500 which is (again) reasonable but then to add new turbos to that and other new parts (I'm spending a lot before labor) Next would be that I could just stick with what I have and essentially do a rebuild. (Again a lot of money) Now I know all of these are costly, but I'm pretty torn on what route I should take. I take care of the car it runs as well as it could for having tired turbos and bad valve stem seals. The car again has been paid off for quite some time too.

Should I look into the starter or ignition switch's. I would like some suggestions on where to investigate next.</td>\n",

All you need to do to charge up is to be within 30 50 m of a charging tower or trolley line and you plug in where ever you can find an empty parking spot. There are at least 2 ways this can be done, first, simply by hanging all the charging cables from a single high mast, second by having a trolley line so the cables can be used at the other side of the parking lot.</td>\n",

       "      <td>100% at a certain time: I'm doing a road trip on Saturday morning. I'd like the car to be at 100% before we leave but for as short a time as possible. In the past I'd plug the car in the night before see how long it said it would take to 100% from 80% and stop charging. I'd set an alarm at that time and start charging at the alarm. I also tried scheduled charging / departure but that charged to 100% right away and just preconditioned the car. What's the best way to charge to 100% but scheduled so it gets to 100% right before we leave?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Feedback/Question about 2021 Model Y LR real-world range estimates from ACTUAL owners…: I'm in the research phase of shopping for an EV, and I'm centering in on a Model Y Long Range, and in my research, I've seen reports of people saying they're getting near the advertised range, some getting in the 200's, and even a few (albeit disgruntled) people saying they never get over 200. I understand it's mainly relative to your specific driving style, local climate, etc... but I'd love feedback from ACTUAL owners on what they're experiencing. I live in the southeastern US, so it gets hot in the summer, but not VERY cold in the winter. My area also has a decent amount of hills. I've also been told I KINDA have a lead foot, but at most, I drive around 40 miles a day, so I'm not worried about local driving, but when I do take trips, can I trust what the supercharger map is telling me what a hypothetical trip would be? I'm sorry if I'm rambling, but it's overwhelming trying to make sense of it all. The nearest dealer is almost 200 miles away so a quick hop over for a test drive really isn't in the picture, so Reddit is my go-to for questions. Thanks in advance!</td>\n",

I have a Gen 3 Wall Connector at home for my Model 3 LR. I charged it a \"full\" 80% about 5 days ago and still have 201 miles of range on it. Should I leave it plugged in all the time even if I'm not driving that day or wait until it gets down to 20%? One Redditor advised it is good to wait and charge when it gets to 20% for data analysis purposes so my range predictions will be more accurate. For an idea of the amount of driving I do. We bought it on 12/19. The drive home after buying was 118 miles. The car currently has 334 miles on it, so I'm averaging about 108 miles a week.\n",
       "115    Tesla and quality control before shipping: Why there is no proper quality control in factory? Probably 90% of users in this sub complain about quality and issues they had to fix after delivery, every YouTuber making fun of Tesla because of their panel gaps and fit in general and it takes forever to fix this issues because of even worse customer support. I mean, how hard it is to hire extra people to check fit and finish inside factory before shipping? * It will save tons of money to Tesla compared to after delivery fixes * Less calls to customer support and they might improve support for people with more serious issues * More time for service center and their technicians to fix more serious issues and faster turnaround * Way less bad reviews because of stupid panel gaps. Reason for posting this is that Ford is pushing hard Mach-E to YouTubers for reviews and every Mach-E review I have seen, says that Mach-E is better because of fit and finish, there's literally no other benefit to get Mach-E but when people pay $50k+, this details matter. Even Model Y they provided to MKBHD, had freaking panel gaps. How dumb person in charge for delivering car to MKBHD was to ignore this kind of issues? Am I missing something or why Tesla prefers after delivery fixes over fixing this minor details in factory? Are they willing to spend more in after delivery fixes and risk negative reviews just to increase \"delivery numbers\"? It's really weird move from company that doesn't spend any money in marketing and it sales literally depends on good reviews... And I haven't seen any Tesla reviews or other EV comparison to Tesla in which reviewer doesn't mention Teslas terrible support and fit and finish.\n",

The n63 as we all know performs best on paper. Now I've been looking into numerous things I can do to extend the life of my car without actually replacing it being that it's paid off. First solution would of course be doing the labor intensive valve stem seal job. Which I was quoted from a local indy mechanic $3000. Which is actually a bit more reasonable than getting it done at bmw which would probably charge me $4000-5000 more Next would be getting the crate motor from bmw costing 3500 which is (again) reasonable but then to add new turbos to that and other new parts (I'm spending a lot before labor) Next would be that I could just stick with what I have and essentially do a rebuild. (Again a lot of money) Now I know all of these are costly, but I'm pretty torn on what route I should take. I take care of the car it runs as well as it could for having tired turbos and bad valve stem seals. The car again has been paid off for quite some time too. Any n63 owners that can give me any advice on what they've done outside of the bmw ccp?\n",

Is there any kind of meter that keeps track of how much energy has flown through the battery pack? This would be a very useful gauge of the life expectancy of one of the most critical (and expensive) components. An odometer is nice for ICEs but for EVs, it would be nice to know how many watt hours my new or used battery pack has used. This will be a necessary (opinion) feature if they ever roll out battery to grid or home powering like the Ford Lightning. This will also be needed for already announced features of the CT like 240v power output as in charging your camper/tiny home as Elon already disclosed.\n",

Which blew the main fuse and fusible link. I also replaced the starter switch. After replacing the blown components I installed a fully charged battery. When I press the starter button it dims the headlamp and will crank or make the clicking noises. The bike is up on a stand, kick stand is up, kill switch is in run position. Should I look into the starter or ignition switch's. I would like some suggestions on where to investigate next.\n",

All you need to do to charge up is to be within 30 50 m of a charging tower or trolley line and you plug in where ever you can find an empty parking spot. There are at least 2 ways this can be done, first, simply by hanging all the charging cables from a single high mast, second by having a trolley line so the cables can be used at the other side of the parking lot.\n",

I'd like the car to be at 100% before we leave but for as short a time as possible. In the past I'd plug the car in the night before see how long it said it would take to 100% from 80% and stop charging. I'd set an alarm at that time and start charging at the alarm. I also tried scheduled charging / departure but that charged to 100% right away and just preconditioned the car. What's the best way to charge to 100% but scheduled so it gets to 100% right before we leave?\n",

I understand it's mainly relative to your specific driving style, local climate, etc... but I'd love feedback from ACTUAL owners on what they're experiencing. I live in the southeastern US, so it gets hot in the summer, but not VERY cold in the winter. My area also has a decent amount of hills. I've also been told I KINDA have a lead foot, but at most, I drive around 40 miles a day, so I'm not worried about local driving, but when I do take trips, can I trust what the supercharger map is telling me what a hypothetical trip would be? I'm sorry if I'm rambling, but it's overwhelming trying to make sense of it all. The nearest dealer is almost 200 miles away so a quick hop over for a test drive really isn't in the picture, so Reddit is my go-to for questions. Thanks in advance!\n",

There are at least 2 ways this can be done, first, simply by hanging all the charging cables from a single high mast, second by having a trolley line so the cables can be used at the other side of the parking lot.
