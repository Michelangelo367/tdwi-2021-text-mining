All you need to do to charge up is to be within 30 50 m of a charging tower or trolley line and you plug in where ever you can find an empty parking spot. There are at least 2 ways this can be done, first, simply by hanging all the charging cables from a single high mast, second by having a trolley line so the cables can be used at the other side of the parking lot.  \n",

My main fear of getting a Tesla or any EV for that matter is it's a question of when not if that my wife/kids gets in and tries to drive off without unplugging the charger. Please tell me there is some safety feature or interlock that prevents movement while connected to the charger.   \n",
       "9                      Quadlock case with new charging pad TM3/Y: Hello everyone, I'm waiting just to get some job stability to buy my first Tesla, either 3 or Y, haven't decided. I have a motorcycle and use a Quadlock to mount my phone onto my handlebar. It's a nifty system but the case has a small ridge on the back, which could be too thick for the new wireless pads and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with a Quadlock case on the new 3/Y wireless charging pads. TIA and happy new year.   \n",
       "10                               Mobile Connector problem question.: I have been having problems with the Mobile Connector that came with my model 3. It seems to not connect and charge when it is cold, by cold I mean between 35 and 25 degrees F. It hasn't been that cold for a few weeks here but so far it seems to work fine when it warmer. This is only a hypothesis so I am asking if anyone knows or has had similar experiences. The car charges fine at super and commercial chargers. Thanks in advance.   \n",

Then perhaps be able to rent or buy several suitcases for expanded range and to take advantage of solid state when it comes out.   \n",

I am house hunting for a modest 3 bedroom 2500 SqFt home in Scottsdale, AZ and would love to go fully green and plan to get powerwalls (and of course chargers for our two Tesla's) If anyone here has experience I would greatly appreciate your experiences and costing for both the equipment and install (as well as issues with supply)   \n",

We've been working really hard to support automated Tesla charging for Griddy users with Optiwatt to avoid these spikes, it will be live very soon!   \n",

It does not break when you move the map and can be used from a mobile as well. Before it was a bit tricky to search, the filter was coming off when moving or zooming the map and didn't work from a phone. No it's stable and works on mobile   \n",

I haven't placed my order for tesla yet (waiting to see what happens with the tax credit) but want to be totally ready to go when the time comes and to take advantage of the current 30% tax credit on the charger install. Fingers crossed they pass the GREEN act in the next few months. I would go ahead and order now but if they pass the bill, im going LR. If not SR+.   \n",

This is the world we live in and that's one of the small reasons why tesla is thriving and their direct to customer is the future of car sales. My girlfriend is hell bent on a C8 Z06. For this price we should just get the new Model S!!   \n",

Anyone know exactly or around how much of an impact those tiny little lights actually make, so that I can pay them how many ever cents it costs to shut them up. ​ Thanks.   \n",
       "19  Suspend Charging Cables From Trolley Wires To Increase Accessibility: There are no dedicated EV parking spots that can be blocked. All you need to do to charge up is to be within 30 50 m of a charging tower or trolley line and you plug in where ever you can find an empty parking spot. There are at least 2 ways this can be done, first, simply by hanging all the charging cables from a single high mast, second by having a trolley line so the cables can be used at the other side of the parking lot.   \n",
